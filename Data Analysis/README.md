# Google Play Store Apps

## Overview
This data is about numerous of application with little less than 10.000 in Google Play Store. The info is about name, category, rating, size, number of installation, etc. The other files also contain a more thorough application review on each application per user.

## Introduction
This data provides insight from two different perspective, which are: developer and user. From the number of records application, we can see developer preferences whether on certain category, size, etc. From the number of installs we will know the preferences on customer side with the same method as developer side.

## Popular Category
Each application has its own category for easier access to user based on its needs. If the user want some entartainment, some user might install the application on category games, comic, and books & magazine. Or if the user want some interaction to other people with interesting features then application with category communication, social, or even dating apps might be the answer.
First, we can see the distribution of application category by looking at existing application in Google Play Store

The top 3 category are FAMILY, GAME, and TOOLS which have broad meanings and many application can fall into the categories. This pie chart also represent the developer's side, which mean developer tends to develop FAMILY category.

Contrary to the number of application at the playstore, the number of most installed category is GAME followed by COMMUNICATION with slightly difference. Although category FAMILY and TOOLS still doing great, the one which is surprising is COMMUNICATION category. COMMUNICATION only has 3.27% from the overall application in the Google Play Store but managed to amassed 14.65% from the overall installed application on the user device. This told us the urgency of using great communication application more important than ever whether it's for communicating with family, friends, business partners, clients, all of these are equally important. The lower percentage distribution of COMMUNICATION application in Google Play Store is also caused by preference of user. User tends to not have many different type COMMUNICATION application and stick to one or three max of COMMUNICATION application.   

## Apps Popularity Based on Size
Size put the importance on user preferences, especially on the low end spec handphone with very limited storage. Once more, we can see the preferences on developer and user side by comparing the distribution of application size with the number of installed apps and the amount of available apps on Google Play Store.

It's clear the developer tends to like developing application with smaller size because the graph showing the right-tail or right skewed distribution. Preferences on the user side is more uniform. Although it's more uniform than the developer's, it's slightly tend to favor the smaller size application. The discrepancy between these two shows that the user tend to care more on the functional side (category) rather than the size of application.

## State of Application on Google Play Store
We can see the state of the application's activity by looking at the Last Updated by Year at minimum. The latest Year of this data is at 2018, so we can assume the app which is not updated for more than a year, in this case from 2016 below, is inactive.
