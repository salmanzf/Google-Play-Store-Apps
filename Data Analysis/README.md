## Introduction
This data provides insight from two different perspective, which are: developer and user. From the number of records application, we can see developer preferences whether on certain category, size, etc. From the number of installs we will know the preferences on customer side with the same method as developer side.

## Popular Category
Each application has its own category for easier access to user based on its needs. If the user want some entartainment, some user might install the application on category games, comic, and books & magazine. Or if the user want some interaction to other people with interesting features then application with category communication, social, or even dating apps might be the answer.

Contrary to the number of application at the playstore, the number of most installed category is GAME followed by COMMUNICATION with slightly difference. Although category FAMILY and TOOLS still doing great, the one which is surprising is COMMUNICATION category. COMMUNICATION only has 3.27% from the overall application in the Google Play Store but managed to amassed 14.65% from the overall installed application on the user device. This told us the urgency of using great communication application more important than ever whether it's for communicating with family, friends, business partners, clients, all of these are equally important. The lower percentage distribution of COMMUNICATION application in Google Play Store is also caused by preference of user. User tends to not have many different type COMMUNICATION application and stick to one or three max of COMMUNICATION application.
